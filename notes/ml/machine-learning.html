  <h1>Introduction to Machine Learning</h1>
  <p>Imagine you’re teaching your little cousin to recognize fruits. You show them a red round fruit and say, “This is an apple.” Then you show a yellow long one and say, “This is a banana.” After seeing a few more apples and bananas, the next time you hand them a fruit they’ve never seen, they guess, “Is this an apple?” based on what they learned.</p>
  <p>Now imagine doing the same thing with a computer—showing it lots of pictures of apples and bananas, and letting it learn the difference on its own. That’s Machine Learning! It’s like teaching a computer by example, so it can start recognizing patterns and make smart guesses, just like your cousin did.</p>
  <div class="section" id="intro to ml">
    <h2>What is Machine Learning ?</h2>
    <p>Machine Learning is a way of <b>teaching computers</b> to learn from data and examples, instead of giving them step-by-step instructions.</p>
    <p>In simple terms, just like humans learn by practicing and seeing examples (like learning to ride a cycle or solve a math problem), machines can also learn from experience—which in this case is lots of data. Once the computer has learned enough patterns from the data, it can start making decisions, predictions, or recognizing things on its own.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="analogy" id="ml example">
    If we give a computer thousands of photos of cats and dogs, and tell it which ones are cats and which ones are dogs, it will start noticing patterns (like ears, fur, size). Later, if we show it a new photo, it can guess if it’s a cat or a dog—based on what it has learned earlier.
  </div>
  <div class="section" id="key idea of ml">
    <h2>Key Idea</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Not hard-coded rules, but learning from data.</li>
      <li>The more data it sees, the better it learns.</li>
      <li>Used in: spam filters, recommendation systems (like YouTube/Netflix), voice assistants, self-driving cars, etc.</li>
    </ul>
  </div> 
  <div class="section" id="data">
    <h2>Learning with Data</h2>
    <p>Remember your cousin learning fruits? You showed them many apples and bananas, and they slowly figured out how to tell them apart. But what exactly helped them learn?</p>
    <p>It was the examples you gave — their size, color, shape, and the correct names (labels).</p>
    <p>Now, imagine doing this with a computer. You don’t “explain” the logic of what makes an apple an apple. Instead, you feed the computer a lot of data that includes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Features (like color, shape, size)</li>
      <li>Labels (like fruit name: apple or banana)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>And the computer learns patterns from this data.</p>
    <p>The more clear, correct, and well-organized the data, the easier it is for the machine to understand and learn. If the data is messy or confusing (e.g., calling a banana an apple), the machine gets confused — just like your cousin would!</p>
  </div>
  <div class = "analogy" id = "data definition">
    Data is the foundation of machine learning. It serves as the source from which machines learn patterns, relationships, and insights. In machine learning, data is generally categorized into two main types: <strong>labeled</strong> and <strong>unlabeled</strong> data.
  </div>
  <div class="section" id="analogy">
    <h2>Analogy</h2>
    <p>In machine learning, we can understand the learning process through a simple analogy. Imagine the machine as a student trying to learn a concept. Instead of having a teacher explain everything step by step, this student learns by reading a notebook full of examples. In this analogy, the machine is the student, the data is the notebook, and the algorithm is the method the student uses to study. The machine does not receive direct instructions or rules. Instead, it studies the data, looks at many examples, and gradually learns patterns and relationships on its own. This is how machines learn to make predictions or decisions — by identifying patterns in the data they are given.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="section" id="importance of data">
    <h2>Importance of Data</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Machine Learning doesn’t learn by rules, it learns by patterns.</li>
      <li>Patterns come from data.</li>
      <li>If you want a machine to perform well (like recognizing diseases, or translating languages), you need to feed it enough good data.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class = "section" id="types of data">
    <h2>Types of Data</h2>
    <p>In Machine Learning, data is the key ingredient. The type and quality of data used directly impact how well a model learns and performs. Based on the presence or absence of labels (answers), machine learning data is generally divided into the following types:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Labeled</li>
      <li>Unlabeled</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="section" id="labeled data">
    <h2>Labeled Data</h2>
    <p>Labeled data contains both the input and the correct output (label). Each example in the dataset tells the machine what the correct answer should be. This type of data is used in Supervised Learning, where the goal is to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs. For example, a dataset of fruit features (color, shape, size) along with their names (apple, banana) is labeled data.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="analogy" id="labeled data analogy">
    We can understand this with a simple analogy. Imagine a child learning to recognize fruits. A parent shows the child different fruits and says, “This is an apple,” or “This is a banana.” Over time, the child learns to associate certain shapes, colors, and sizes with the correct fruit names. Here, the fruit's features are the input, and the fruit's name is the label. The child is essentially learning from labeled data.<br><br>
    A similar process happens in machine learning. The machine is shown many examples, each with the correct label, and it learns to make predictions based on that.
  </div>
  <div class="section" id="table labeled data">
    <h2>Sample Labeled Data</h2>
    <table cellpadding="8" cellspacing="0">
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Color</th>
          <th>Shape</th>
          <th>Size</th>
          <th>Fruit Name (Label)</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>Red</td>
          <td>Round</td>
          <td>Small</td>
          <td>Apple</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Yellow</td>
          <td>Long</td>
          <td>Medium</td>
          <td>Banana</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Green</td>
          <td>Round</td>
          <td>Small</td>
          <td>Apple</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Yellow</td>
          <td>Round</td>
          <td>Small</td>
          <td>Lemon</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>In this table, the machine sees the features of each fruit (color, shape, size) along with the correct name (label). Using this data, it learns how to predict the name of a new fruit just by looking at its features.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="section" id="unlabeled data">
    <h2>Unlabeled Data</h2>
    <p>Unlabeled data contains only input features, without any correct output or label. This type of data is used in unsupervised learning, where the machine explores the data and tries to find patterns or group similar items on its own — without being told what the correct answer is.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="analogy" id="unlabeled data analogy">
    To understand this better, imagine giving a child a basket full of different fruits, but without telling them the names. The child may try to group similar-looking fruits together — putting round red ones in one pile, long yellow ones in another. Even though they don’t know the names, they are recognizing patterns. This is similar to how a machine works with unlabeled data.<br><br>
    In machine learning, when we remove the label column from a dataset, the machine is left with only the features. It then applies algorithms like clustering to group or analyze the data.
  </div>
  <div class="section" id="table unlabeled data">
    <h2>Sample Unlabeled Data</h2>
    <table cellpadding="8" cellspacing="0">
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Color</th>
          <th>Shape</th>
          <th>Size</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>Red</td>
          <td>Round</td>
          <td>Small</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Yellow</td>
          <td>Long</td>
          <td>Medium</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Green</td>
          <td>Round</td>
          <td>Small</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Yellow</td>
          <td>Round</td>
          <td>Small</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>
      In this table, the machine sees only the features of each fruit — such as color, shape, and size — but not the actual name of the fruit. Since the labels are missing, the machine cannot directly learn which feature set belongs to which fruit. Instead, it tries to group similar rows together based on shared characteristics. For example, it might notice that some fruits are round and small, while others are long and medium-sized. By identifying these patterns, the machine can organize the data into meaningful clusters, even without knowing the actual fruit names.

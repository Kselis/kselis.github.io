  <h1>Introduction to Machine Learning</h1>
  <p>This document provides a beginner-friendly introduction to Sequence Models, explaining what they are, why they are important, and how they differ from traditional machine learning models. Using simple analogies and real-life examples, it covers the core concepts behind modeling sequential data—like language, time series, and speech.</p>

    <h2>What is Machine Learning ?</h2>
    <p>Machine Learning is a way of <b>teaching computers</b> to learn from data and examples, instead of giving them step-by-step instructions.</p>
    <p>In simple terms, just like humans learn by practicing and seeing examples (like learning to ride a cycle or solve a math problem), machines can also learn from experience—which in this case is lots of data. Once the computer has learned enough patterns from the data, it can start making decisions, predictions, or recognizing things on its own.</p>

  <div class="analogy" id="ml example">
    <h2>Example :</h2>
    <p>If we give a computer thousands of photos of cats and dogs, and tell it which ones are cats and which ones are dogs, it will start noticing patterns (like ears, fur, size). Later, if we show it a new photo, it can guess if it’s a cat or a dog—based on what it has learned earlier.</p>

    <h2>Key Idea</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Not hard-coded rules, but learning from data.</li>
      <li>The more data it sees, the better it learns.</li>
      <li>Used in: spam filters, recommendation systems (like YouTube/Netflix), voice assistants, self-driving cars, etc.</li>
    </ul>
